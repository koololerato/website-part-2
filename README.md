# Website Project â€“ Part 2 (CSS Styling & Responsive Design)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **external CSS**, **responsive design**, and **user-friendly styling**.  
It was developed as part of my PoE submission and includes:

The website adapts across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries.
